<h3>What's new?</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Requires Joomla 4.2 and PHP 7.4 or later</strong>. We have dropped support for earlier versions of Joomla and PHP to do the preliminary work necessary for compatibility with Joomla 5.0, with a target release date of October 2023. According to our collected usage statistics Joomla 4.0, 4.1 and PHP versions 7.2, 7.3 make up for less than 1.5% of our users.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Removed PHP version warnings. This is now included in Joomla itself.</strong>. Nearly 8 years ago we started displaying warnings about your PHP version when it was entering maintenance mode (only security updates issued for one year) and when it was about to become or had already become End of Life (no updates, not even for security). To our delight, this helped our clients plan for PHP upgrades and resulted in their sites using recent, actively maintained PHP versions. Starting with Joomla 3.7, the Joomla project itself started doing the same, having seen the overwhelmingly positive impact these warnings had to our mutual users. In Joomla 3.10 and beyond Joomla's warnings about PHP versions are essentially identical to ours. Therefore, there is no longer a reason for us to include these warnings in our software.

	<strong>Bug fixes and minor improvements</strong>. Please take a look at the CHANGELOG below.
