<h3>What's new?</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Requires Joomla 4.2 and PHP 7.4 or later</strong>. We have dropped support for earlier versions of Joomla and PHP to do the preliminary work necessary for compatibility with Joomla 5.0, with a target release date of October 2023. According to our collected usage statistics Joomla 4.0, 4.1 and PHP versions 7.2, 7.3 make up for less than 1.5% of our users.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Removed PHP version warnings. This is now included in Joomla itself.</strong>. Nearly 8 years ago we started displaying warnings about your PHP version when it was entering maintenance mode (only security updates issued for one year) and when it was about to become or had already become End of Life (no updates, not even for security). To our delight, this helped our clients plan for PHP upgrades and resulted in their sites using recent, actively maintained PHP versions. Starting with Joomla 3.7, the Joomla project itself started doing the same, having seen the overwhelmingly positive impact these warnings had to our mutual users. In Joomla 3.10 and beyond Joomla's warnings about PHP versions are essentially identical to ours. Therefore, there is no longer a reason for us to include these warnings in our software.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Bug fixes and minor improvements</strong>. Please take a look at the CHANGELOG below.
</p>

<h3>Namespace changes</h3>

<p>
	We have changed the PHP namespaces of our plugins to match the (actually not documented anywhere) intention of Joomla's core maintainers about third party extensions. For example, Admin Tools' system plugin has changed its namespace from <code>Joomla\Plugin\System\AdminTools</code> to <code>Akeeba\Plugin\System\AdminTools</code>.
</p>
<p>
	This has two implications:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Joomla! caches the namespaces of core and third party extensions in the <code>autoload_psr4.php</code> file in its cache directory. By default, this file is located in <code>administrator/cache/autoload_psr4.php</code>. Joomla! is <em>supposed</em> to delete and create afresh this file whenever it is updating extensions or itself. However, under some circumstances (e.g. the file or its containing directory cannot be written to by PHP), this may not be possible. You may have to delete that file yourself.
	</li>
	<li>
		Servers with PHP OPcache —or a similar code cache— enabled may have settings which prevent PHP from “seeing” the changes in the updated files of our extension, or Joomla!'s <code>autoload_psr4.php</code> file. Joomla! tries to reset code caches on extension and core updates. However, the server configuration may prevent this from taking effect. If this happens, you will need to ask your host to reset the OPcache.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Despite us and Joomla! itself taking all reasonable precautions to prevent such a change from causing a problem, some server configurations are outside ours and Joomla!'s control, making it impossible to successfully mitigate problems. If your site stops responding with an error indicating that a class cannot be found follow the advice above, namely:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Delete the <code>administrator/cache/autoload_psr4.php</code> file.
	</li>
	<li>
		Ask your host to reset the OPcache, or similar code cache, on your site's server.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Kindly note that this is a <strong>one-time</strong> change. The namespace of our extensions will not change in the future, unless of course Joomla! itself necessitates a change (nothing like that is, however, planned for any Joomla version released until 2027 at the earliest).
