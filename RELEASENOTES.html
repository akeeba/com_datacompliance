<h3>What's new</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Joomla 4 improvements</strong>.
	We applied necessary changes in our code to support Joomla 4 beta 7. Along with that came a few
	unexpected but welcome improvements. Labels in the tabbed interface elements are more legible.
	Custom selects are now rendered as native selects. Checkboxes are rendered as native checkboxes.
	Long lists and multiselect lists are back into using Chosen for easier item selection.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Darker Dark Mode</strong>.
	Our Dark Mode was intentionally designed to be somewhat bright. This had two side-effects. On one hand it was brighter than the dark templates most people would use. Moreover, the contrast between the background and the text was inadequate for people with vision-related disabilities. Considering that Dark Mode is (also) an accessibility feature we addressed this concern.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Removed the recommended PHP version</strong>.
	This has been a source of confusion. The recommended PHP version was placed in the code manually
	when a new version was finalised, which would typically be two to three weeks before it's
	released. The previous version released in early January was finalised between around December
	3rd, before PHP 7.3 entered its final ‘security fixes only’ support phase. This led to the
	discrepancy of our software warning you that PHP 7.3 is getting old in the tooth and needs to be
	upgraded but also saying that the recommended version if 7.3. Since the PHP version warning is
	time-based, using the official PHP supported versions timeline dates, we decided to remove the
	recommended versions altogether from these messages and replace them with a note in our
	Compatibility page that you should always use the latest version of a currently supported PHP
	branch which is marked as being in ‘active development’.
