<h3>What's new?</h3>
<p>
	<strong>New backend and frontend frameworks</strong>.
	This version of our software has been rewritten using the new versions of our FOF (backend) and FEF (frontend) frameworks. The new framework versions load faster, unify our common CSS and JavaScript among all of our extensions, allow us to load all JavaScript defered for better performance and help us provide a much better experience on the upcoming Joomla 4 version.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>View templates are now stored in the tmpl folder instead of ViewTemplates</strong>.
	This change makes it possible to make template overrides for our software in Joomla 4's template manager.
	Existing template overrides are not affected. Template overrides are still stored in the same location
	in your template.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Kills the redirection imposed by the Joomla privacy consent to avoid an infinite redirection loop</strong>.
	When the Joomla privacy suite copied DataCompliance's code to implement a captive login they forgot to
	copy the part of the code which prevents conflicts with other extensions using the same technique. As a
	result having both DataCompliance and Joomla's privacy suite enabled at the same time would result in an
	infinite redirection loop. We have now added a workaround which kills Joomla's redirection so that
	DataCompliance can work. You are still recommended to disable Joomla's privacy consent when you are using
	Akeeba DataCompliance.
