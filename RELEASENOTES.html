<h3>What's new?</h3>

<p>
	<strong>Add Show Inline Help support in component options for Joomla 4.1</strong>. <em>This feature adds support for a new Joomla core feature coming in Joomla 4.1.3</em>. The Options page is currently very busy with the long descriptions of every single option. Starting with Joomla 4.1.3 these descriptions will be hidden by default. A button labeled “Show Inline Help” will appear on the site's Toolbar. Clicking on it reveals the descriptions.
