PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS="Data Compliance - Akeeba Subscriptions"
PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_DESCRIPTION="GDPR Data Compliance plugin for Akeeba Subscriptions"
PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_DOMAINNAME="Akeeba Subscriptions"

PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_ERR_HASSUBS="You have purchased %u subscription(s) within the last %u days. We cannot delete your account until this many days elapse since this information is used for tax reporting and as evidence of service provisioning in case of a payment dispute."
PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_ERR_HASSUBS_GENERAL="This user has %u active subscription(s). We cannot delete this account until they expire."

PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_LIFECYCLE_LABEL="User account lifecycle"
PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_LIFECYCLE_DESC="When enabled, this plugin will locate obsolete user accounts which need to be automatically removed from the site to comply with GDPR. Obsolete user account criteria can be defined below."

PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_THRESHOLD_LABEL="Last expired subscription this many months ago"
PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_THRESHOLD_DESC="User accounts whose last subscription expired this many months ago."

PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_GUARD_THRESHOLD_LABEL="Non-lifecycle deletion exemption threshold (days)"
PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_GUARD_THRESHOLD_DESC="If a user bought a susbcription in the last X days (this setting) they will not be allowed to delete their account. Recommended to be set to the maximum payment dispute time period. Set to 0 to disable this feature AT YOUR OWN RISK (you may delete active susbcribers). Please note that this does not apply to removal due to user account lifecycle. In that case <em>any</em> active subscription will prevent the account from being deleted since an active susbcription is proof of an active business relation with the client, therefore you are allowed to retain their personal information."

PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_LASTVISIT_LABEL="Exclude users who have visited the site in the meantime"
PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_LASTVISIT_DESC="Should I consider active (not include for lifecycle deletion) user accounts whose last subscription expired per the option above BUT they have also visited the site in the meantime? It's recommended to set this to Yes since these users have demonstrated interest in accessing their information, providing you with a valid business reason to retain their data."

PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_ACTIONS_1="Your abandoned subscription attempts (where you never tried to pay) will be deleted."
PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_ACTIONS_2="All other subscriptions and subscription attempts (where you tried to pay, no matter if it was successful or not) will be pseudonymized by replacing the transaction identifier with a random one and removing the IP address and browser User Agent information from them. Any notes we had made on the subscription, e.g. recording a special circumstance for giving you a discount, will be removed."
PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_ACTIONS_3="All invoicing information we have collected on our system will be removed."
PLG_DATACOMPLIANCE_AKEEBASUBS_ACTIONS_4="All invoices and credit notes will be removed from our site. Clarification: we are legally required to keep a backup copy of the actual invoices and credit notes and an off-line record with their metadata for at least ten fiscal years since the transaction took place. This obligation overrides your right to be forgotten per the GDPR, therefore these copies will not be deleted but they will also not be used for any other purpose than taxation and legal obligations of the company."
