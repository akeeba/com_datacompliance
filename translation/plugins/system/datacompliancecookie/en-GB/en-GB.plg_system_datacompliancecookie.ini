PLG_SYSTEM_DATACOMPLIANCECOOKIE_COOKIENAME_LABEL="Preferences cookie name"
PLG_SYSTEM_DATACOMPLIANCECOOKIE_COOKIENAME_DESC="This cookie is always stored on the user's browser when they make a choice (accept or reject cookies on our site). This is legal since this is a mandatory cookie for the correct operation and does not store any personal information about the user (not even their IP address). Default: plg_system_datacompliancecookie"

PLG_SYSTEM_DATACOMPLIANCECOOKIE_ALLOWSESSIONCOOKIE_DESC="Allow Joomla's session cookie even if the user has rejected cookies. This is most likely legal since the EU GDPR allows setting mandatory cookies without which the site cannot work (session cookies being exactly that)."

PLG_SYSTEM_DATACOMPLIANCECOOKIE_ADDITIONALCOOKIEDOMAINS_LABEL="Additional cookie domains"
PLG_SYSTEM_DATACOMPLIANCECOOKIE_ADDITIONALCOOKIEDOMAINS_DESC="By default, this plugin will remove the cookies set on the Cookie Domain you have configured in Joomla's Global Configuration. If your site sets cookies in other subdomains you should enter them here. Putting a dot in front of a domain catches cookies in all subdomains. For example, <code>.example.com</code> catches both www.example.com and foobar.example.com. Most sites do not need to set this option."

PLG_SYSTEM_DATACOMPLIANCECOOKIE_COOKIESENABLEDUSERGROUP_DESC="The current session's user will be (temporarily) added to this user group when they accept the cookies.

PLG_SYSTEM_DATACOMPLIANCECOOKIE_PERMANENTUSERGROUPASSIGNMENT_LABEL="Permanent User Group assignment"
PLG_SYSTEM_DATACOMPLIANCECOOKIE_PERMANENTUSERGROUPASSIGNMENT_DESC="Makes the user group assignments permanent. When the user accepts cookies they are added forever to the “Cookies accepted User Group” and removed from it when they reject cookies (or their acceptance expires). When the user rejects cookies they are added forever to the “Cookies rejected User Group” and removed from it when they accept cookies. Obviously, it only works for logged in users."
