PLG_SYSTEM_DATACOMPLIANCECOOKIE_DESCRIPTION="<strong>DEPRECATED â€“ JOOMLA! 3 ONLY</strong>. Allows your site to comply with the cookie law by disabling cookies unless explicitly allowed.<br/>This plugin only works on Joomla 3 and is considered deprecated. It will be removed when a Joomla 4-only version of this component (Akeeba DataCompliance 2.0) will be released."

PLG_SYSTEM_DATACOMPLIANCECOOKIE_COOKIENAME_LABEL="Preferences cookie name"
PLG_SYSTEM_DATACOMPLIANCECOOKIE_COOKIENAME_DESC="This cookie is always stored on the user's browser when they make a choice (accept or reject cookies on our site). This is legal since this is a mandatory cookie for the correct operation and does not store any personal information about the user (not even their IP address). Default: plg_system_datacompliancecookie. You may want to set it to something descriptive, such as exampledotcom_cookie_storage_preferences"

PLG_SYSTEM_DATACOMPLIANCECOOKIE_IMPLIEDACCEPT_LABEL="Implied cookie acceptance"
PLG_SYSTEM_DATACOMPLIANCECOOKIE_IMPLIEDACCEPT_DESC="Should the user be assumed to have provided their implicit consent by visitng the site? Note that this may not be legal. Ask your lawyer. Setting this to No is the legally safest option."

PLG_SYSTEM_DATACOMPLIANCECOOKIE_DONOTTRACK_DESC="What to do when the Do Not Track (DNT) HTTP header is sent by the user's browser? Ignore DNT will simply ignore the DNT header. Overried implied default will replace the Implied Cookie Acceptance value above with the preference in the DNT header (the cookie banner will be shown). Treat as user's choice will record the DNT header as the user's preference (the cookies banner will NOT be shown). The latter option may not be legal; ask your lawyer. The legally safest choice is Override Implied Default."

PLG_SYSTEM_DATACOMPLIANCECOOKIE_ADDITIONALCOOKIEDOMAINS_DESC="By default, this plugin will remove the cookies set on the Cookie Domain you have configured in Joomla's Global Configuration. If your site sets cookies in other subdomains you should enter them here. Putting a dot in front of a domain catches cookies in all subdomains. For example, <code>.example.com</code> catches both www.example.com and foobar.example.com. Most sites do not need to set this option."
